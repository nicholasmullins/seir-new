### _AAU, when viewing a movie's detail page, I want to be able to add a new performer to the list_

Thinking about the steps necessary to implement the above user story:

- We will use a `<form>` to send an HTTP request used to to associate a performer and movie on the server.
- The `<form>` will include a `<select>` dropdown to include the selected performer's `_id` in the payload of the request. 
- The movies controller's `show` function will provide the list of performers used to render the `<option>` tags for the dropdown, however, we only want to include the performers in the dropdown that are not already in the cast!

Let's do this - here's our wireframe:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zg0pCYa.png">

#### Passing the _Performers_ for the `<select>` Dropdown

Currently, the `moviesCtrl.show` function is just passing the `movie`, but now it also needs to query for the _performers_ that are not already associated with the `movie` and pass them to **show.ejs** as well.

First, we're going to need to access the `Performer` model, so require it at the top of **controllers/movies.js**:

```js
const Movie = require('../models/movie');
// require the Performer model
const Performer = require('../models/performer');
```
	
Now we're ready to refactor the `show` action, we'll review as we refactor the code:

```js
function show(req, res) {
  Movie.findById(req.params.id)
    .populate('cast')
    .exec(function(err, movie) {
      // Mongoose query builder approach...
      // Performer.find({}).where('_id').nin(movie.cast)
      // Native MongoDB approach...
      Performer.find(
        // Query object that only finds performers
        // whose _ids are not in the movie.cast array
        {_id: {$nin: movie.cast}},
        function(err, performers) {
          console.log(performers);
          res.render('movies/show', {
            title: 'Movie Detail',
            movie,
            performers
          });
        }
      );
    });
}
```

The log will show we are retrieving the _performers_ - a good baby step at this point. 

#### Render the `<form>` in **movies/show.ejs**

Again, there are comments to help us as we refactor **show.ejs** to render

```html
<!-- movies/show.ejs -->
	
<!-- add to cast form below this comment -->
<form id="add-per-to-cast" action="???" method="POST">
  <select name="performerId">
    <!-- Emit an option for each performer -->
    <%- performers.map(p => 
      `<option value="${p._id}">${p.name}</option>`
    ).join('') %>
  </select>
  <button type="submit">Add to Cast</button>
</form>
```

Now let's add this tidbit of CSS in **public/stylesheets/style.css** to tidy up the cast list:

```css
ul {
  margin: 0 0 1rem;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
	
li {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

#### Identify the Proper Route to Perform the Association

Let's check out the [Routing Guide](https://gist.github.com/jim-clark/17908763db7bd3c403e6) to find the endpoint (keep looking...).

The route is RESTful for adding an association between a movie and a performer but it's up to use to think of a good name for that action.

Note that there are two proper routes, however, the one that matches our scenario, where the id of the performer is being sent in the payload of the request, is this:

```
POST /movies/:movieId/performers
```

Remember, you can call the route parameter, `:movieId`, whatever you wish, e.g., `:id`

#### üëâ You Do - Update the `<form>`'s `<action>` Attribute (1 min)

- Now that the proper route has been identified, update the `action="???"` in the Add to Cast `<form>`.

</summary>
<hr>

<code>
&lt;form id="add-per-to-cast" action="/movies/<%= movie._id %>/performers" method="POST"&gt;
</code>

<hr>
</details>

#### Add the Route for the _Add to Cast_ `<form>` Post

In **routes/performers.js**:

```js
// POST /movies/:id/performers
router.post('/movies/:id/performers', performersCtrl.addToCast);
```
`addToCast` - not a bad name!

Last step coming up!

#### Code the _addToCast_ Controller Action

We could perform the association in either controller - we'll go with the **controllers/performers.js** because it's not as crowded:

```js
// controllers/performers.js
	
module.exports = {
  new: newPerformer,
  create,
  addToCast
};
	
function addToCast(req, res) {
  Movie.findById(req.params.id, function(err, movie) {
    // The cast array simply holds the performer's ObjectId
    movie.cast.push(req.body.performerId);
    movie.save(function(err) {
      res.redirect(`/movies/${movie._id}`);
    });
  });
}
```

Reads like a book!

```js
const bookSchema = new Schema({
  authors: [{type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Author'}],

(1) True or False:  Assuming the above <code>bookSchema</code>, the <code>authors</code> property would properly implement a <code>Book >--< Author</code> relationship.

(2) Describe the difference between 1:M & M:M relationships.

<hr>

<p>In a 1:M relationship, the "child" document belongs to only one parent and we have to create that dedicated child document.</p>

<p>However, in a M:M relationship, we are associating existing documents and they can have/belong to any number of documents.</p>
